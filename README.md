# Commit Analyzer

This repository contains a number of markdown parsers (found in the `parsers` directory) that validate markdown for a number of criteria:

* Valid JSON front-matter
* Valid Markdown
* All images are in the `images` directory (this should be configurable later)
* All links resolve

# Usage

These scripts are highly experimental currently and are unlikely to work without modification.
